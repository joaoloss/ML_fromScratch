# ML_fromScratch
Here you will find some important machine learning algorithms I've implemented from scratch to understand how all these stuff work under the hood.

Note 1: the focus is only on the implementation itself.

Note 2: the implemantaions are simple. I didn't want to spend too much time on it, it's just to give me some intuition.

Note 3: I've learned these concepts in Andrew Ng's ML specialization on Coursera, so some things might be inspired from there.
